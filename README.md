# Responsive portfolio website using Bootstrap.

Note to Frank: I slightly changed the design to suit my taste a little better. I intend to use it so I wanted to make mine from the get-go. 

These are the things I changed:

I went with centering my name and navigation on all screen sizes. 

Portfolio Items are also centered:

Frank, I coded a separate page to satisfy homework layout requirements which I will remove after you check it. It's Portfolio Homework. That link is only visible on the home page, I didn't code it into any other pages.
